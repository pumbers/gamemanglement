      <description>After hearing and reading so much about it, I decided to dive in and try out Thousand Year Old Vampire by Tim Hutchings. I have it in my head that I&amp;rsquo;d like to play a young Frankish knight from the Dark Age reign of Charlemagne, so I dig out my copy of Paladin: Warriors of Charlemagne by Ruben in ’t Groen because not only is it a great historical RPG but it also provides a lot of the detail for the initial period that I&amp;rsquo;ll need.</description>

      <description>There are many mysteries, wonders and dangers in the Ten Thousand Worlds, some of them are worth a lot of money to those brave enough to investigate them. Most of them will kill you stone dead.
Welcome to the Ten Thousand Worlds.
The Vylk Enclave   The Vylk are the only (known) alien race in the Ten Thousand Worlds, and the Vylk Enclave is a marvel of megastructure engineering. By far the largest of the Worlds, and likely one of the oldest, it sits on the outer edge of the system far above the plane of the ecliptic.</description>

      <description>Swept away by the huge wave, Eirik and Sherman struggled to stay afloat for what seemed like hours, but was probably only a few minutes. Their feet first brushed, then settled on solid ground and, as the water drained away, they could just make out in the dim Fuzz light, that they had come to rest on a smooth stone floor. Beyond more than a dozen feet or so, what little light there was faded into a grey nothingness.</description>

      <description>Standing in the doorway of the Alchemist&amp;rsquo;s Tower, the blood drained from Sherman&amp;rsquo;s face as he looked out onto streets swarming with green-eyed undead shambling and stumbling toward them.
&amp;ldquo;How many?&amp;rdquo;, said Eirik, limbering up his massive shoulders and arms ready for the coming fight.
&amp;ldquo;Err&amp;hellip; all of &amp;lsquo;em, I think&amp;rdquo;, said Sherman. Eirik&amp;rsquo;s face went blank with thought.
&amp;ldquo;Door?&amp;rdquo;, asked Sherman. &amp;ldquo;Door&amp;rdquo;, Eirik nodded, and they started looking around for something to bar the door with.</description>

      <title>Ten Thousand Worlds: Adepts</title>

      <description>Cybernetics in the Worlds are pretty common, used to replace damaged or missing limbs or other organs. Adepts, however, take the use of cybernetics and implanted technologies to the next level. Their implants are always far more advanced than anything freely available, sometimes even alien in origin, and they have used this to build an air of mysticism around what they are capable of, referring to the effects they create as “hexes” or “incantations”.</description>

      <description>Soon after the Influx, the Captains of the great colony ships and the first stations established themselves as absolute rulers of their domains. Power was passed down through their family lines and those of their subordinates, and over the centuries they built great trading empires, fleets and Worlds.
Hundreds of families formed the Great and Lesser Houses of these Dynasties, with their reach and influence appearing supreme. They felt they had the right and privilege to do anything, to anyone.</description>

      <description>When last we saw our heroes, they had just been hired by local &amp;ldquo;businessman&amp;rdquo; and rather colorfully-dressed elf, Gwindore, to head for the catacombs far above Bone Falls and search for another party of adventurers sent in some weeks ago and who have not reappeared since. Gwindore was willing to pay them 10 keys each with another 5 keys per adventurer found alive. Cuthmar had still not appeared after the party lost him in the tunnels outside Bone Falls days ago, and now Celiophane had also gone missing, but intent on making a fast fortune, Sherman and Eirik set on their way.</description>

      <description>When we first met our heroes, they were already well on the way to making a name for themselves. Sherman, Cuthmar, Eirik and Celiophane had taken on the task of rescuing a local merchant’s daughter from a band of marauding goblins, tracked the goblins to their cave-lair and fought their way to the goblin shaman who was about to make a blood sacrifice of the young girl. They figured they’d won, but with his dying breath the shaman uttered a dire curse.</description>

Welcome to the Ten Thousand Worlds.
The Testament of Cycles The Testament of Cycles is, looking at at it simplistically, a book - but quite unlike any other book in existence. Firstly, it is not a physical object (although physical copies of parts of it have been made).</description>

      <description>The Ten Thousand Worlds is a (work-in-progress) futuristic science fantasy setting. If you want to get a feel for life in the Worlds, think Firefly, a bit of Guardians of the Galaxy, some Doctor Who and Farscape and a fair bit of The Expanse.
Introduction Somewhere, in a star system light years away and a long time ago, Earth died.
The Human Race, knowing the end was coming, migrated en masse to a new home.</description>

      <description>Memory: Always Leaving My father tells me that I must be prepared to take Renier&amp;rsquo;s place in service at Autelbas. Although this may be years away and it is my duty to do so, I do not relish the thought of leaving my home in service to another. I leave home anyway, on my own terms, to find my own destiny. →  I must leave this place before I am found again.</description>

      <description>Memory: Becoming Undead In my wandering I come across the Black Man, the silhouette of a man without a heart carved out in the granite rock just south of Christnach, and meet the Lady Brielle there. She enchants me, and I find myself in her company more often than not until one morning I awake to find myself branded across my body with devil&amp;rsquo;s marks and Brielle gone. I feel&amp;hellip; different, a thirst I did not have before threatens to overcome me in the company of others.</description>

      <description>Memory: My Family My elder brother, Renier, returns from his service at Autelbas for a brief visit. He goes hunting with my father, but his horse falls and he receives grievous injuries which take him from us a few days later. My father is inconsolable. →  Aelis, my sister, hears that I have returned and finds me at Mainet&amp;rsquo;s a few days later. I tell her of my curse but instead of fleeing in terror at my appearance she gives me her gold crucifix to wear hoping it will calm the darkness within me, and although I can scarcely bear to touch it I take it from her.</description>

      <description>Memory: My Father  I am Grimaud, son of Guillaume de Fremay, vassal knight to our lord Duke Thierry of Ardennes in the year of God 767 AD. For my youth, I would hunt with my father in the forests around our manor at Fremay. →  My father, on my eighteenth birthday, gives me the gift of my first sword. I have trained with many, but this one is mine and I will one day pass it on to my son, as my father&amp;rsquo;s sword will be mine when he passes.</description>

      <description>Memory: Chase and Escape The forest has been my home for more years than I can count, the animals and people of Fremay and nearby villages my prey for that time, and although I have tried to be careful rumors of the &amp;ldquo;Branded Man&amp;rdquo; are growing. Lone travelers are too easily spotted, but horse trains have become commonplace for goods transport and maybe I can use that to my advantage. As long as I stay covered and can hold my hunger for a time, I can travel without suspicion for a new life far from here.</description>

      <description>Memory: Wilderness Taking what few belongings I have, I lose myself in the forest where I slake my hunger for fresh blood on the animals there. I write of my family, and their fates, in the margins of Renier&amp;rsquo;s bible finding solace in reliving my time with them and relieving me of some of my shame. →  Out here on the moors there is little cover and concealment, but for some time now I have discovered I can take shelter from the daylight under the marshes and bogs; as with the lake, it is not a pleasant experience but it works well enough, so I endure.</description>
