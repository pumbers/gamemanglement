      <description>This first session of Ultraviolet Grasslands using Cypher System started off well enough, after a few weeks of planning and a Session Zero that built the characters, but fell flat when the GM (me) was hit by a power cut and lost all network connectivity other than Discord on my cellphone. But hey, these things are sent to make us stronger.

      <title>Thousand Year Old Vampire: Journal of Grimaud de Fremay</title>

      <description>After hearing and reading so much about it, I decided to dive in and try out Thousand Year Old Vampire by Tim Hutchings. I have it in my head that I&amp;rsquo;d like to play a young Frankish knight from the Dark Age reign of Charlemagne, so I dig out my copy of Paladin: Warriors of Charlemagne by Ruben in ’t Groen because not only is it a great historical RPG but it also provides a lot of the detail for the initial period that I&amp;rsquo;ll need.</description>

      <title>Star Empires for Roleplaying: The Hyperion Cantos</title>

      <description>When it comes to science-fiction roleplaying games, Traveller is granddaddy of them all, and it has it&amp;rsquo;s own setting (the Third Imperium) that&amp;rsquo;s been around from day one. Outside role-playing (but supported by several different games over the years) you have universes such as Star Wars, Star Trek and, more recently, The Expanse. But what other &amp;ldquo;universes&amp;rdquo; are there out there for adventuring, what kinds of stories might they inspire, and what RPG systems suit their particular style of story telling.</description>

      <title>Mysteries, Wonders and Dangers of The Ten Thousand Worlds: Part 2</title>

      <description>There are many mysteries, wonders and dangers in the Ten Thousand Worlds, some of them are worth a lot of money to those brave enough to investigate them. Most of them will kill you stone dead.
Welcome to the Ten Thousand Worlds.
The Vylk Enclave   The Vylk are the only (known) alien race in the Ten Thousand Worlds, and the Vylk Enclave is a marvel of megastructure engineering. By far the largest of the Worlds, and likely one of the oldest, it sits on the outer edge of the system far above the plane of the ecliptic.</description>

      <title>Wolves of God: Adventures in Dark Ages England</title>

      <description>It is 710 AD. It is an age of iron and ruin, a wolf-season amid the ashes of Roman Britain. The spears of the English tribes are raised against their rivals, and the Wealh of the western hills remember bitterly what was taken from them. The shattered caesters of past Roman glory litter the land, each one laden with forgotten troves hidden by desperate men of the last days. Sorcerous Arxes once sealed against a Roman rescue that never came are now cracking open, the changed refugees within now seeking vengeance for a ruin of centuries past.</description>

      <description>Swept away by the huge wave, Eirik and Sherman struggled to stay afloat for what seemed like hours, but was probably only a few minutes. Their feet first brushed, then settled on solid ground and, as the water drained away, they could just make out in the dim Fuzz light, that they had come to rest on a smooth stone floor. Beyond more than a dozen feet or so, what little light there was faded into a grey nothingness.</description>

      <description>Standing in the doorway of the Alchemist&amp;rsquo;s Tower, the blood drained from Sherman&amp;rsquo;s face as he looked out onto streets swarming with green-eyed undead shambling and stumbling toward them.
&amp;ldquo;How many?&amp;rdquo;, said Eirik, limbering up his massive shoulders and arms ready for the coming fight.
&amp;ldquo;Err&amp;hellip; all of &amp;lsquo;em, I think&amp;rdquo;, said Sherman. Eirik&amp;rsquo;s face went blank with thought.
&amp;ldquo;Door?&amp;rdquo;, asked Sherman. &amp;ldquo;Door&amp;rdquo;, Eirik nodded, and they started looking around for something to bar the door with.</description>

      <title>Ten Thousand Worlds: Adepts</title>

      <description>Cybernetics in the Worlds are pretty common, used to replace damaged or missing limbs or other organs. Adepts, however, take the use of cybernetics and implanted technologies to the next level. Their implants are always far more advanced than anything freely available, sometimes even alien in origin, and they have used this to build an air of mysticism around what they are capable of, referring to the effects they create as “hexes” or “incantations”.</description>

      <description>Soon after the Influx, the Captains of the great colony ships and the first stations established themselves as absolute rulers of their domains. Power was passed down through their family lines and those of their subordinates, and over the centuries they built great trading empires, fleets and Worlds.
Hundreds of families formed the Great and Lesser Houses of these Dynasties, with their reach and influence appearing supreme. They felt they had the right and privilege to do anything, to anyone.</description>

      <description>When last we saw our heroes, they had just been hired by local &amp;ldquo;businessman&amp;rdquo; and rather colorfully-dressed elf, Gwindore, to head for the catacombs far above Bone Falls and search for another party of adventurers sent in some weeks ago and who have not reappeared since. Gwindore was willing to pay them 10 keys each with another 5 keys per adventurer found alive. Cuthmar had still not appeared after the party lost him in the tunnels outside Bone Falls days ago, and now Celiophane had also gone missing, but intent on making a fast fortune, Sherman and Eirik set on their way.</description>

      <title>Chivalry &amp; Sorcery - 5th Edition, First Read</title>
      <link>https://pumbers.github.io/game-manglement/posts/cns_5th_review/</link>

      <description>In recent years, we&amp;rsquo;ve seen a lot of early RPGs, such as Traveller and Runequest, resurrected in new editions with cleaner rules and more modern presentations which, for the most part, have retained the original feel of the game. Chivalry &amp;amp; Sorcery has seen several editions over the years, the last almost 20 years ago in 2000 (not counting the 2011 &amp;ldquo;Essence&amp;rdquo; release which was only 44 pages). Now, following a successful Kickstarter, a new 5th Edition has returned at a whopping 602 pages.</description>

      <description>When we first met our heroes, they were already well on the way to making a name for themselves. Sherman, Cuthmar, Eirik and Celiophane had taken on the task of rescuing a local merchant’s daughter from a band of marauding goblins, tracked the goblins to their cave-lair and fought their way to the goblin shaman who was about to make a blood sacrifice of the young girl. They figured they’d won, but with his dying breath the shaman uttered a dire curse.</description>

      <description>The Star Trek Adventures: Command Division sourcebook introduced stats for new ships from Star Trek canon, many of which have either never been seen or seen only rarely on-screen. Among them is the Norway Class, which was designed by the Advanced Starship Design Bureau for rapid emergency response. So, what&amp;rsquo;s it like being on the crew of one of these ships, what adventures can you have and how do you handle them?</description>

Welcome to the Ten Thousand Worlds.
The Testament of Cycles The Testament of Cycles is, looking at at it simplistically, a book - but quite unlike any other book in existence. Firstly, it is not a physical object (although physical copies of parts of it have been made).</description>

      <title>Welcome to The Ten Thousand Worlds</title>
      <link>https://pumbers.github.io/game-manglement/campaigns/ten_thousand_worlds/introduction/</link>

      <guid>https://pumbers.github.io/game-manglement/campaigns/ten_thousand_worlds/introduction/</guid>
      <description>The Ten Thousand Worlds is a (work-in-progress) futuristic science fantasy setting. If you want to get a feel for life in the Worlds, think Firefly, a bit of Guardians of the Galaxy, some Doctor Who and Farscape and a fair bit of The Expanse.
Introduction Somewhere, in a star system light years away and a long time ago, Earth died.
The Human Race, knowing the end was coming, migrated en masse to a new home.</description>

      <title>Star Trek Adventures: Fighters</title>

      <guid>https://pumbers.github.io/game-manglement/articles/sta_fighters/</guid>
      <description>The Command Division sourcebook for Star Trek Adventures includes, almost hidden away in the Federation Small Craft chapter, the details of the Federation Attack Fighter, also called the Zabathu1 class (after an Andorian riding animal). This is really the first reference in the rules made to any sort of fighter class ship and, to be sure, such craft are rarely seen in Star Trek itself. Most ship battles on screen are between two or more capital ships which make up the vast majority of any faction’s fleet.</description>
