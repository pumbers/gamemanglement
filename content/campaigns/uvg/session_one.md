_This first session of Ultraviolet Grasslands using Cypher System started off well enough, after a few weeks of planning and a Session Zero that built the characters, but fell flat when the GM (me) was hit by a power cut and lost all network connectivity other than Discord on my cellphone. But hey, these things are sent to make us stronger. The second session went a little better._

## Our Heroes

**Aberama Gold** is a Violet City doghead inquisitor. He came to the Violet City some time ago by ship from across the Circle Sea and now works for the noble cats of the Violet Citadel (he knows the cats are the real lords). He wields the power of the Purple Goddess and hunts for doghead insurrectionists in and around the city. Aberama has spent some time out in the Purple Land of the Cat hunting his quarry, but he's recently heard portents of a deadly machine demon who might be able to overthrow his masters. He's gathering a crew to head out into the grasslands to investigate, but also to see if he can make some cash.

**Leo** is an adept, new to the Violet City, having come here to find new magicks for his master (including one very special one). He's heard about caravans to the Grasslands and is interested in joining one to further his quest.

**Pascale** is a lyrical accountant, a number cruncher who specializes in creating poetic ledgers that embody subjective beauty and emotional truth as well as being numerically accurate. Her life is driven by her abacus, which somehow shows a new number at the start of every day, a number which often dictates or at least provides the basis for Pascal's actions that day. Today, Pascale's abacus reads **632**.

## The Story Begins

Afternoon in the **Violet City** is a complicated affair. Like cities of the **Before Times**, the Violet City never sleeps, but its level of wakefulness does change as the day rolls by, in particular when the purple haze of the cocktail hour arrives. The sounds and smells of the city seem somehow more restrained, and the tendencies of some folks lean towards contemplation, siesta and coffee.

It is at this time we find our Heroes (capital H), gathering in **The Under-Dog Cafe** in the Charger's Ward of the city. Sure, the city is ruled by the ever-present **Cat Lords**, but that doesn't mean there isn't room for the odd, illicit establishment serving Dog Coffee instead of the ubiquitous Cat Coffee. In this case, the Under-Dog is in this modest commercial district, not far from the **Marut**, an ancient stone colossus of unweathered stone, where local merchants come to make contracts (it is said that anyone who breaks an oath sworn upon the Marut will be slain before the next dawn. Probably not true, but then who would dare find out the hard way).

Outside, as the shadow of **The Shrine of Georguy** (a stone niche enshrining the holy symbol of Georguy, Lord of Protection, said to reveal visions to those who leave an offering) falls across the basement windows of the cafe, our heroes are deep in conversation...

## The Covered Market

Leaving the Under-Dog Cafe, our Heroes head out into the covered market.

They travel but a few tens of yards when a figure steps from behind a pillar, a tall woman dressed in leather and metal with tattoo glyphs on her face, and calls "Leo!", then as they stop "You'll never find it! Your old Master, Sire Lemtep was a fool to entrust it to you!"

"I'm sorry", said Leo, "Do I know you?"

"You're a fool as well. Kill them, kill them all!"

From behind nearby boxes and pillars, four more figures dressed in black leather wearing ancient **biochemtech** masks, step into the light and move menacingly toward our Heroes.

Judging **Aberama** to be the bigger threat (he's carrying a **Halbered** and has a **Violent Cat Rifle** slung on his shoulder), the woman opens fire with a handgun, hitting Aberama square in the chest and staggering him back. Undeterred, Aberama swings his halberd at the two nearest leather-clad thugs then, pushing them back, moves to take on the woman.



## Finding A Caravan

Following a lead from a nearby notice board, our Heroes note caravan of six dwarves heading into the Grasslands, bound for Potsherd Crater, to scout for caches of old tech for their recycling business. The caravan will use three mules and two guzzolene walkers.

Six dwarves, three mules, two walkers. 6-3-2. Pascale's eyes light up[^1].

Our Heroes head to the nearby industrial district where they find two dwarves hard at work in their workshop.

"Not open yet!" the shorter dwarf hollers past the stogie stuck in his mouth.

"We're here about the ad," says Aberama, "for the caravan."

"We ain't got much room for passengers, and we're only heading to Potsherd Crater. We can maybe make space for you for about 500&euro; a week."

"No, we want to sign-on to work. I've got this halberd I can swing, Pascale here is good with numbers and Leo, what **do** you do,Leo?"



[^1]: The dialog was more "Six dwarves, three mules, two walkers, Pascale."  "What?" "Six dwarves, three mules, two walkers." "Yeah, I know, I heard you." "Six, three and two." "OK, so?" "632" "Uh, OK?" "What number did your abacus say this morning?" "Six three t... OH!"
